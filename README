Acute Software Code Doc Data [alpha]

written by Duncan Murray 14/8/2013 (C) Acute Software

This is the python implementation of code_doc_data which allows you to
automatically add documentation to a database (or CSV file) of your batch
processes.


Note, you need to first edit the cdd_config.py to chose how to keep logged information

   --- USAGE DURING BATCH PROCESS ---
   import code_doc_data as cdd
   cdd.InitProject('TEST', 'Test project to see how it works', '')
   cdd.CopyFile ('test.doc', 'test_backup.doc', 0)
   cdd.DownloadFile ('http://www.....com/datapage.html', 'dataFile.csv' )
   cdd.LoadData ('dataFile.csv', 'S_DATA_STAGING')
